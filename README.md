Why Hello There üëãüèª

My name is Logan, I have just been through an intensive 15-week program in which we learned Git, HTML, HTMX, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, relational databases, test-driven development (TDD), RESTful APIs, and unit testing. It also included Human Skill elements and reflections to develop soft skills. With this foundation of programming knowledge, I also look to take on the challenge of learning PHP and investing time into learning Administrative Systems and Authentication.

From my previous employment, I bring with me a various set of skills which include customer service and knowledge in online ordering systems which come from my time working with Bunnings, I also bring my teaching and soft skills and the ability to adapt to various scenarios with my time being a Ski Instructor at Snowplanet

When I'm not immersed in the Tech space, I love to spend my free time riding my motorcycle and if you ask about it I will chat your ear off about it also and if I'm not on my bike it is either because I'm fixing it or I'm on the slopes if its good weather otherwise you will find me outside with my dog or inside with my dog binge watching the same tv show for the 10th time
